# Odin Recipes

## About the project

This is the first complete project, built at the end of the HTML foundations path of The Odin Project.

It's composed by an index page which contains links to some recipe pages.

## What i have learned

I have applied the knowledge accumulated during this path, namely:

- HTML boilerplate
- ordered and unordered lists
- using hyperlinks
- displaying pictures and write explicitly about their attribution and license

## What i couldn't do

Since i had to use only HTML, i put \<br> tags to end longer lines.<br>
Character sizing is the default for each tag, which is not eye-candy at all.<br>
I couldn't find proper free to use images to resemble te recipes.<br>
